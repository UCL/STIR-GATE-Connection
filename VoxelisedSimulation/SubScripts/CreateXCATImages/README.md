This directory is used to create XCAT files for GATE simulation.

* `create_XCAT.par`: parameter files to generate XCAT images
* `CreateXCATImage.sh`: creates (i) input_image_atn_1.bin and (ii) input_image_act_1.bin. licence is needed
* `input_image_atn_1.hv`: Header file for input_image_atn_1.bin. User needs to check that image size and voxel size match with the one of "create_XCAT.par".
