This directory contains a collection of scripts that are key to automatically finding and computing variables for GATE simulations.

Scripts
=======
* `EstimateGATESTIRNorm`: Creates normalisation correction sinogram from GATE measured data and STIR model data. 
* `GenerateSTIRGATEImages.sh`: Generates STIR images from parameter files for GATE simulation. The attenuation file voxel values are heavily scaled and should not be used in STIR. Use the original attenuation file.
* `GetAttenuationTranslation.sh`: shell script that reads an image with STIR and returns shifts for the attenuation translation.
* `GetSourcePosition.sh`: shell script that reads an image with STIR and returns the source position offset for GATE
* `PrepareScannerFiles.sh`: shell script that copies scanner files from the specified scanner example directory. This script is required to be run first to copy the correct data into `VoxelisedSimulation/`.
* `STIR2GATE_interfile.sh`: shell script that converts STIR generated interfile headers (.hv) into GATE compatible headers (.h33) files and adds the parameters "!number of slices" and "slice thickness (pixels)".
*WARNING* the `get_*.sh` scripts put the centre of the STIR image at the GATE 0,0,0.  
Therefore they assume that the GATE scanner is defined as in `ExamplesOfScanners`. Shifting the centre of the GATE scanner is currently going to break things.
* `SumData.sh`: A script that sums a number of image/sinogram data into a common file.
* `UnlistCoincidences.sh`: script used to unlist a `*.root` file. Creates a `*.hroot` with the correct filename and energy information and paramerter file for STIR's `lm_to_projdata` functionality. 

Comments
=======
* Concatenating root files: Use the ROOT provided tool `hadd` (`hadd --help` for more information).
* Combining interfile sinograms: Use `stir_math`.
