This directory contains a collection of scripts that are useful for debugging. Please note, these may not be maintained and are generally used for development.

Scripts
=======

* `UnlistRandoms.sh`: Script unlists a root file coincidences twice, once with all coincidence event types and once without the randoms. Subtracting one from the other results in a sinogram of only randoms.
* `UnlistScatter.sh`: Script unlists a root file coincidences twice, once with all coincidence event types and once without the scatter. Subtracting one from the other results in a sinogram of only scattered events.
