Directories
===========

* ExamplesOfScannersMacros: contains examples of macros for creating a scanner in GATE
* ExamplesOfPhantomMacros: contains examples of macros for creating/importing source and attenuation phantoms
* VoxelisedXCAT: example of GATE simulation from XCAT images.


Things to do
=============
* change the mMR template to the "real" one (8x8 crystals, not 8x9) (needs STIR mods)
* find XCAT dimensions from the XCAT file as opposed to hard-wiring
* find GATE image specifications from Interfile headers
* find GATE sinogram specifications from STIR Interfile header or vice versa
* can even find durations and energy windows from Interfile headers
