About
===========
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple method to: 
- create a GATE compatible voxelised phantom from a STIR parameter files or interfiles using STIR functionality,
- setup and run GATE in cluster array jobs,
- combine and unlist root files into STIR compatible sinograms for reconstruction, and
- compute normalisation factors, scatter correction, and random correction from the measured GATE data using STIR.


See `STIR-GATE-Connection/VoxelisedSimulation/README.md` for a Tutorial.

New to GATE? Checkout their website (http://www.opengatecollaboration.org/) and their incredibly useful UsersGuide (https://opengate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

Requirements
=============

This project is reliant on: ROOT, current STIR `master` branch (https://github.com/UCL/STIR/tree/master) installed with ROOT support, and GATE version 9.0. GATE has dependancy on Geant4 and ROOT. Both STIR install `bin` and GATE `bin` must be in your `PATH`.

STIR-GATE-Connection requires the `SGCPATH` enviromental variable to be set to this primary directory (containing this README file). Many scripts use this variable when executing sub-scripts.


Directories
===========

* `ExamplesOfScannersMacros/`: Contains examples of macros for creating a scanner in GATE.
* `ExamplesOfPhantomMacros/`: Contains examples of macros and STIR parameter files for creating/importing source and attenuation phantoms.
* `VoxelisedSimulation/`: Main GATE simulation directory.


Files
=====

* `this_SGC.sh`: This script sets the `SGCPATH` enviromental variable. It also adds `SGCPATH` to PATH. Additional enviromental variables are added for the major project directories. See script for more details.
